* Assimilation VS Accomodation: 
  * Assimilation of knowledge occurs when a learner encounters a new idea, and must ‘fit’ that idea into what they already know. Think of this as filling existing containers.
  * Accommodation of knowledge is more substantial, requiring the learner to reshape those containers. You can think of these containers as ‘schema.’ Schema are fluid and constantly evolving vessels students use to process what they see, read, and feel.
