# Overthinking in Human
* Assumption -> Overthinking -> Worried about non-existing problem -> Again overthink about solution
* No reason for assumptions unless there is instinctive/intuitive/intellectual power 
* Assumption: Human nature of escaping the reality to find itself in pleasure. Yes, by neglecting the existing problems and creating new problems in our mind, we ENJOY our mind with stressful situation. It is human nature. But MANAGEMENT of stress is important. There should be a limit to stressing. With every action there is reaction. Stress is one of the reactions. We can't avaoid it but control it. To control it we have to stop CREATING stressful situations by assuming irrelevant things.
* Detective in relationship: Lack of trust, trust issues, past personal experiences may lead to spying and interfering in the personal life of the partner.
