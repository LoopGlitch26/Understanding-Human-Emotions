* Irrational Emotions are those emotions that are in tension with our evaluative judgements which occur 
due to recalcitrance. Let's consider a situation where your partner is dancing with someone else in an open club
or Salsa club. It's completely normal to trade partners for dance in a salsa club. But once the irrational thoughts take over
like jealousy, your judgemnt will change and convert into irrational emotions. 

* According to the "Affect-Program theory" by Paul Griffiths in 1997, irrational emotions occur when emotions are triggered 
by appraisal mechanisms that arenâ€™t cognitively penetrated.

* Irrational Emotions example: "A human being is a bundle of useless passions" John-Paul Saetre.
