* **Irrational Emotions** are those emotions that are in tension with our evaluative judgements which occur 
due to recalcitrance. Let's consider a situation where your partner is dancing with someone else in an open club
or Salsa club. It's completely normal to trade partners for dance in a salsa club. But once the irrational thoughts take over
like jealousy, your judgemnt will change and convert into irrational emotions. 

* According to the **"Affect-Program theory"** by Paul Griffiths in 1997, irrational emotions occur when emotions are triggered 
by appraisal mechanisms that arenâ€™t cognitively penetrated.

* Irrational Emotions example: "A human being is a bundle of useless passions" John-Paul Saetre. 

* Emotions do impose a **paradox**

* **Emotional intelligence** begins with self and social awareness, the ability to recognize emotions (and their impact) in both yourself and others. That awareness begins with reflection. You ask questions like:
  * What are my emotional strengths? What are my weaknesses?
  * How does my current mood affect my thoughts and decision making?
  * What's going on under the surface that influences what others say or do?
  
  * You pause, analyse, think and then speak or act, one of the most important aspects of emotional intelligence. Pausing helps you refrain from making a permanent decision based on a temporary emotion. 

  * You don't have much control over the emotion you experience in a given moment. But you can control your reaction to those emotions--by focusing on your thoughts. (As it's been said: You can't prevent a bird from landing on your head, but you can keep it from building a nest.) By striving to control your thoughts, you resist becoming a slave to your emotions, allowing yourself to live in a way that's in harmony with your goals and values.

  * You benefit from criticism. When you receive negative feedback, you keep your emotions in check and ask yourself: How can this make me better?

  * You demonstrate empathy. Empathy doesn't necessarily mean agreeing with another person's point of view. Rather, it's about striving to understand--which allows you to build deeper, more connected relationships.
  
  * You praise, apologise, give helpful feedback, forgive and forget, stick to commitments, etc. which can also be a sign of maturity.
  
* Emotional Intelligence has a dark-side. Such as when individuals attempt to manipulate others' emotions to promote a personal agenda or for some other selfish cause. (I personally always do, to learn human brain and their emotions, and try to figure out the constants and variables on a more probable scale)
